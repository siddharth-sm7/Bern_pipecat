# Pipecat ESP32 Client SDK

## 💻 Platform/Device Support

This SDK has been developed and tested on a `esp32s3` and `linux`. You don't
need any physical hardware to run this SDK, but it will be very limited
(e.g. you won't hear an audio on Linux).

To use it on hardware purchase any of these microcontrollers. Others may
work, but this is what has been developed against.

## 📋 Pre-requisites

Clone this repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-esp32.git
```

Install the ESP-IDF toolchain following these
[instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).

After that, just open a terminal and load ESP-IDF tools:

```
source PATH_TO_ESP_IDF/export.sh
```

We also need to set a few environment variables before we can build:

```
export WIFI_SSID=foo
export WIFI_PASSWORD=bar
export PIPECAT_SMALLWEBRTC_URL=URL (e.g. http://192.168.1.10:7860/api/offer)
```

where `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` are just needed to connect the device to
the network. `PIPECAT_SMALLWEBRTC_URL` is the URL endpoint to connect to your
Pipecat bot.

## 🛠️ Build

Go inside the `esp32-s3-box-3` directory.

The first thing to do is to set the desired target, for example:

```
idf.py --preview set-target esp32s3
```

You can also set `linux` instead of `esp32s3`.

Then, just build:

```
idf.py build
```

If you built for `linux` you can run the binary directly:

```
./build/src.elf
```

## 🔌 Flash the device

If you built for `esp32s3` you can flash your device using the following commands:

### Linux

```
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash
```

where `/dev/ttyACM0` is the device where your ESP32 is connected. You can run
`sudo dmesg` to know the device on your system.

On Debian systems, you will want to add your user to the `dialout` group so you
don't need root access.

### macOS

```
idf.py flash
```

## ▶️ Usage

Currently, you can try `pipecat-esp32` with one of the Pipecat foundational
examples. For example, from the Pipecat repository you can run:

```
python examples/foundational/07-interruptible.py --host IP --esp32
```

where `IP` is just your machine IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.10). Then, you would
set the environment variable `PIPECAT_SMALLWEBRTC_URL` as explained above.
